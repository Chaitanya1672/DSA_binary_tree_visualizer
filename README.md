# DSA Tree Visualizer

## Overview
This project provides a JavaScript-based tree data structure visualization tool for studying and understanding various tree-related algorithms and data structures.

## Features
- **Tree Visualization**: Easily visualize different types of trees (e.g., Binary Trees, AVL Trees, etc.).
- **Algorithm Animation**: Step through and observe the algorithms on the visualized tree.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Intuitive controls for adding, removing nodes.

## Usage
1. Add or remove nodes as needed from Text Box.
2. Use the controls to trigger algorithms and observe the visualization (Apply & Reset).
3. You can add numbers and null(to ignore specific node) values.

## Demo
